# Ideas

## Layout 1

Have in a struct -

Name         : Str : Name of Spell

Total        : Int : Total number of mentions

Occurrences  : []  : Line number of each occurrence

Type         : Str : Category of spell


## Layout 2

Maybe have different structures for each page? Or one with all info, and another without list of occurrence locations

## Parsing

Could splice together all txt files and then run
If statement to just get each spell out? Import as set and check if in
Find a list of all spells!

- Keep a note which lines each book start and end on
- Visualisation is just a matter of making dot on percentage of total number of lines
