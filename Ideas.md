# Ideas


Have in a struct -

Name        : Str : Name of Spell
Total       : Int : Total number of mentions
Occurences  : []  : Line number of each occurrence
Type        : Str : Category of spell


Could splice together all txt files and then run
If statement to just get each spell out? Import as set and check if in
Find a list of all spells!

- Keep a note which lines each book start and end on
- Visualisation is just a matter of making dot on percentage of total number of lines
